see if some code can be shared with django-stdimage

currently, images will not be re-filtered if the caption field changes
each filter should have the opportunity to contribute to a "watch list" of fields to observe for changes. if any of those fields change, the filter chain is re-run

south field introspection rules should take account of changes to the filter list and regenerate images when needed.

style options should be:
cut to fill
overflow to fill
fit within

enlarge_if_smaller=True
